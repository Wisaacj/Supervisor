Streaming the result of your object detection pipeline involves capturing the processed video frames and broadcasting them over a network. This can be accomplished using various methods and libraries, but one commonly used approach in Python is through the use of `Flask`, a lightweight WSGI web application framework, along with `Flask-SocketIO` for real-time communication.

### Step 1: Install Flask and Flask-SocketIO

Before implementing the streaming server, ensure you have Flask and Flask-SocketIO installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO
```

### Step 2: Implement Streaming Server

You'll need to modify your script to include a Flask application that streams the annotated video frames. Hereâ€™s an approach using a generator function to yield video frames, which the Flask app can then send as a response:

```python
from flask import Flask, Response, render_template
from flask_socketio import SocketIO
import cv2
import threading

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app)

# Global variable to hold the latest processed frame
current_frame = None

# Your existing ObjectDetector class and main function here

def gen_frames():
    global current_frame
    while True:
        if current_frame is not None:
            ret, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', current_frame)
            frame = buffer.tobytes()
            yield (b'--frame\r\n'
                   b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n')
        else:
            # If no frame is available, yield a placeholder or simply pass
            yield (b'--frame\r\n'
                   b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + b'\r\n')

@app.route('/video_feed')
def video_feed():
    # Return the response generated along with the specific media type (mime type)
    return Response(gen_frames(),
                    mimetype='multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame')

def run_flask_app():
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)

def process_video_stream():
    global current_frame
    capture = cv2.VideoCapture(STREAM_URL)
    pipeline = ObjectDetector()

    if not capture.isOpened():
        raise RuntimeError("Couldn't open video stream.")
    
    print("Stream opened successfully.")

    while True:
        ret, frame = capture.read()

        if not ret:
            raise RuntimeError("Couldn't read a frame.")
        
        # Process the frame
        annotated_frame = pipeline.detect(frame)
        
        # Update the current frame to be the latest processed frame
        current_frame = annotated_frame

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            print("Stopping video processing.")
            break

    capture.release()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Launch the Flask app in a separate thread
    threading.Thread(target=run_flask_app, daemon=True).start()

    # Continue with the video processing
    process_video_stream()
```

### Step 3: Accessing the Stream

- Once everything is set up and the Flask app is running, you can access your stream by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/video_feed` from a browser on the same machine.
- If you want to access the stream from other devices in the network, use the host machine's local network IP address instead of `localhost` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.XXX:5000/video_feed`).

### Notes

- The Flask server is set to listen on all available IP addresses (`host='0.0.0.0'`) and port `5000`.
- This setup uses Flask to stream JPEG frames using a technique known as MJPEG streaming.
- The `gen_frames` function continuously yields frames, which are then rendered by the browser as a video stream. This way, you can view the object detection results in real time.
- Keep in mind that running a Flask app with `debug=True` is not recommended for production environments.

This solution provides a relatively simple and effective way to stream your object detection results over a local network.
